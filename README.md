# Plant Health Classification

This project provides plant health information through leaf images by using a deep neural network, specifically a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model takes an image of a leaf as input and classifies it as either healthy, affected by leaf mold, or affected by late blight.

## Description

This was a college project completed by a team of two members. My role involved training the model, fine-tuning parameters, and optimizing the model. The project utilizes CNN, TensorFlow, and NumPy to create the model. The aim was to minimize loss by adjusting gradient descent, which is calculated using weights and biases, and by fine-tuning parameters such as learning rate and epoch size.
